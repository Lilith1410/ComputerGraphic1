# ComputerGraphic1
A student project of University of Applied Sciences in Hanover. 

## Abstract
Goal of this project was the implementation of a computer graphic scenario that build upon the contents of computer graphics 1 lecture. 
Being build over the course of a semester the project was meant to implement all the necessary knowledge of building a functioning program. 
This was achieved by building a base of theoretical knowledge through the contents of individual lectures and practical knowledge through various excercises over the course of the semester. 

For this means several different techniques were tried and finally used and the participants of this group gained a vast knowledgebase. 

## Instructions 
Alternatively you could unzip the provided .zip-File and start the script "start.sh" in the folder "project". 
The project should start on its own then. 


## Controls
* Spacebar: toggle fly/examine mode on/off
* arrow keys (fly mode/default): rotate around yaw and pitch axes

  + alt: rotate around roll and pitch axes

* arrow keys (examine mode): rotate around azimuth and elevation axes

  + alt: rotate around roll and elevation axes

* w/s: move forward/backward

  + alt: dolly in/out (relative to center point)

* a/d/x/z: move left/right/up/down (a/d/x/y on German keyboard)
* page up/down: increase/decrease continuous flight velocity
* h: toggle frame rate output (to console)
* j: toggle center point visibility
* k: toggle mouse cursor visibility
* l: toggle polygon mode (fill/line)


## Technologies used
 * Transformationen: Translation, Skalierung, Rotation, 
 * perspektivische Projektion
 * Phong Shader
 * Texture Shader
 * Camera controls 
 * Quaternions (animation)
 * Object modells
